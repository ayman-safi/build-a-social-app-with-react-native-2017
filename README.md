# [Build a Social App With React Native][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


Native mobile apps often perform better and have better features. But native app development often means coding different versions of your app for multiple platforms. React Native, created by Facebook, bridges this gap by letting you write your user interface in modern JavaScript and then transforming it into native platform-specific apps. 

This makes React Native a great way to get into mobile app development without learning a new programming language.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will show you how to create a social application in React Native. You will learn how easy it is to code an app with a Firebase back-end. You'll also learn some advanced topics like sophisticated navigation, camera and photo library access, as well as how to use the device's address book.
